The Odyssey Programme consists of a community of undergraduate students at SPMS, NTU who gather to move and shake the world. 

Throughout the semester, the folk at Odyssey self-organise fortnightly gatherings and student-led research projects centred around topics proposed by undergraduates. These are freely chosen to be as deep or as broad (interdisciplinary) as the students can imagine. Check out our project proposal process [here](). 

The proceedings of our fortnightly meetings and any ad-hoc activities will be shared on this website and on our social media platform. 

Godspeed!
