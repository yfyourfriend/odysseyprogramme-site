SPMS Concurrent Projects for Everyone (SCOPE) submissions! 

This is a new tenet of the Odyssey Programme on top of the yearly Odyssey Research Programme through the summer. 

SCOPE is designed with flexibility and synergy in mind, aimed at undergraduates who wish to explore scientific phenomena from a broad range of fields. Due to its versatility, it is also possible to work together with individuals from different majors at SPMS, and such ventures are highly encouraged.
